## Objective

This product provides aggregated time-series files for each mooring site and parameter (excluding current velocity), without any interpolation or filtering, except for the exclusion of the out-of-water data. The Quality Control (QC) flags are preserved. All the (python) code used for the generation of the products is openly available on GitHub.


## Input

The aggregation function will accept a list of input files, the code of the mooring site (`site_code`) and the name of the variable of interest (VoI).

The code aggregates variables and files that meet the following requirements:

- File contains data from only one deployment of one instrument;
- File is a delayed-mode product, with file version label FV01;
- File is compliant with CF-1.6 and IMOS-1.4 conventions;
- File contains, at the minimum, the VoI, and variables `TIME`, `LATITUDE`, `LONGITUDE`, and `NOMINAL_DEPTH` or the global attribute `instrument_nominal_depth`;
- All files to be aggregated are from the same site, and have the same `site_code` attribute;
- Variables to be aggregated have `TIME` as their only dimension (or if `LATITUDE` and `LONGITUDE` are included as dimensions, they have size 1);
- Variables to be aggregated do not represent current velocity;
- The in-water data are bounded by the global attributes `time_deployment_start` and `time_deployment_end`.

The code is able to access the input files either locally, or remotely via the OPeNDAP protocol. 

## Method

Generating function: 

```
usage: aggregated_timeseries.py [-h] -var VARNAME -site SITE_CODE -files
                                FILENAMES [-path OUTPUT_PATH]

Concatenate ONE variable from ALL instruments from ALL deployments from ONE
site

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  -var VARNAME       name of the variable to concatenate. Like TEMP, PSAL
  -site SITE_CODE    site code, like NRMMAI
  -files FILENAMES   name of the file that contains the source URLs
  -path OUTPUT_PATH  path where the result file will be written. Default ./

```



### Input file validation

Before proceeding to the aggregation, each input file will be checked to ensure it meets the requirements (as specified above under Inputs). Any input files that fail to meet the requirements will be excluded from the aggregation, and their URL listed in a global attribute `rejected_files`.

### Dimensions

The dimensions of the resulting file  are determined as follows:

- `OBSERVATION`:  the total number of observation records, excluding out-of-the-water data, in all input files;
- `INSTRUMENT`: the number of instruments (i.e. number of files);
- `strlen`: a fixed dimension of length 256 for character array variables.

### Variables

The VoI is produced by sequentially concatenating the individual values in each of the input files. The resulting variable has dimension `OBSERVATION`. The VoIâ€™s ancillary_variables, in particular the corresponding quality-control flags, are also included, with dimension `OBSERVATION`. If the quality control variable is absent in any input file, the corresponding flags in the output file will  be set to 0 ("no QC performed") and a warning will be raised.

The variable `TIME` from input files is concatenated into a variable `TIME(OBSERVATION)`. This could result in a non-uniform time interval.

The `DEPTH` variable from input files is concatenated into a variable `DEPTH(OBSERVATION)`. If not present, fill values are stored. `DEPTH_quality_control`, if present, is also included. Where the `DEPTH` variable is absent, the corresponding `DEPTH_quality_control` values are set to 9 ("missing value").

The variables `PRES` (sea_water_pressure) and `PRES_REL` (sea_water_pressure_due_to_sea_water) will be aggregated in exactly the same way as `DEPTH`. Every aggregated file will contain `DEPTH`, `PRES`, and `PRES_REL`, and corresponding quality control flags.

All output variables with the `INSTRUMENT` dimension are sorted in chronological order, and the input files aggregated chronologically, according to the global attribute `time_deployment_start`.

In order to keep track of the provenance of VoI in the aggregated file, accessory variables are created:

- `instrument_index(OBSERVATION)`: index [0:number of files] of the instrument used, referencing the `INSTRUMENT` dimension.

- `source_file(INSTRUMENT, strlen)`: URLs of the files used.

- `instrument_id(INSTRUMENT, strlen)`: concatenated deployment_code, instrument and instrument_serial_number from the global attributes of each file.

- `LATITUDE(INSTRUMENT)`: LATITUDE per instrument.

- `LONGITUDE(INSTRUMENT)`: LONGITUDE per instrument.

- `NOMINAL_DEPTH(INSTRUMENT)`: nominal depth per instrument.  


### Attributes

The variable attributes comply with the IMOS metadata standards.

The global metadata will be a set of IMOS standard attributes. Fixed attributes are read from a JSON file that contains the {key:value} pairs for each of them.

Attributes specific to each aggregated product, are added as follows:

- `site_code`, `local_time_zone`: obtained from the input files (should be the same in all of them);

- `time_coverage_start`, `time_coverage_end`: set to the full range of `TIME` values in the aggregated file;

- `geospatial_vertical_min/max`: set to the full range of `DEPTH` values in the aggregated file;

- `geospatial_lat_min/max`: set to the full range of `LATITUDE` values in the aggregated file;

- `geospatial_lon_min/max`: set to the full range of `LONGITUDE` values in the aggregated file;

- `date_created`: set to the date/time the product file is created;

- `history`: set to "\<date_created\>: Aggregated file created.";

- `keywords`: set to a comma-separated list of the main variable names ("\<VoI\>, TIME, DEPTH, LATITUDE, LONGITUDE");

- `lineage`: a statement about how the file was created, including a link to the code used, and any input parameters (except the input files, which are listed in the source_file variable);

- `title`: "Aggregated time-series product: \<VoI\> at \<site_code\> between \<time_coverage_start\> and \<time_coverage_end\>"

## Output


The output from a single run of the code will be an aggregated file of all available measurements of a single non-velocity variable at one mooring site.

The product will be delivered, in netCDF4 format, compliant with the CF-1.6 and IMOS-1.4 conventions, and
structured according to the [indexed ragged array representation](http://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/v1.6.0/cf-conventions.html#_indexed_ragged_array_representation).
